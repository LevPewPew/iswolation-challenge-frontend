# iswolation-challenge

## By Levente Toth

### Features

- No accounts or authentication, just share a link and go

### Future Developments

- Share links specific to user so as to avoid accidental increase of reps of wrong name by disabling buttons not for that user
- Some fine tuning of responsiveness for display of player name and exercise name

### Lessons Learned

- Use Styled Components (or some other CSS in JS package), style sheets made some features more difficult than it had to be
